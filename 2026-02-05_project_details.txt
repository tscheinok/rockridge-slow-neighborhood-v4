Slide 1:  I think we can say over 5000+ cars a day comfortable through the Lower Rockridge neighborhood
Right side text box:  we should say 3000 average + cars a day with Max 4000+
I think the stats on 90% non-local and 60% reduction are totally debatable and we should NOT include them
I think we could say Hillegass local street 700 max limit and Colby 2000 City, 1500 from Feds.
 
Traffic Pilot Goal – Reduce traffic driving through our neighborhood by 60%
 




Slide 2 – you could link the article from Jane on the statement about Waze, Google etc. Your Navigation App Is Making Traffic Unmanageable | Institute of Transportation Studies
 
It's About to Get Worse
The new Community Center will generate up to 338 additional peak-hour vehicle trips (Fehr & Peers CEQA study JCC-East-Bay-Project-CEQA-Analysis.pdf The section on transportation starts at page 45. And there is an attached study in appendix B. Fehr & Peers, Jewish Community Campus of the East Bay, Transportation Impact Review and Transportation Demand Management Plan, September 2024, attached as Appendix B.  The Project will generate as many as 338 net new peak hour vehicle trips during the a.m. peak hour and 118 net new peak hour vehicle trips during the p.m. peak hour on a typical summer day when Summer Camp is in session.). New developments on College Ave will add even more.
 
Suggest not using JCC as people are sensitive to this and asked us not to that
 
The Problem
 
App-Driven Volume –  -- this study was not supported by UC and we cannot cite this. We could say a researcher in their own time, unpublished found…
 
Bike Boulevard Failure – I thought you said it was 1500 from NACTO (please reference) and city said 2000 -???? Let’s be precise and reference this
 
The DATA
 
The GRAPH - Traffic volume is far beyond safe limits
 
Where are these numbers coming from we have past, future projections and standards and it is confusing. We need to reference them all.
I think we need to FHWA is for what street on what?
The Table is good!  Let’s reference FHWA, NACTO, and city
 
The Solution
The numbers on current peak are not matching what we say above which is 400+
Again we cannot use the ITS model and cite it – Jane said NO
Studies supporting pilot –
5. The beauty of a Pilot: It has an "Undo" button. Finally, I think it’s important to remember what a "pilot" actually is. We are talking about temporary materials—planters and bollards—not pouring concrete. This is a low-risk test. If we install them and the data shows it creates chaos after a few months, we can take them out. It is fully reversible. But if we refuse to even test a solution because we are afraid of a hypothetical outcome, we are making an active choice to accept the dangerous status quo. We know the current situation is unsafe; why are we afraid to try a temporary, reversible experiment to fix it?
